        <h1>About the projects</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout my training as a web developer, I’ve worked on different projects that have helped me gain experience 
            with various technologies. In this portfolio, I’m going to show three of them, explaining a bit about what they are, 
            which technologies I used, and how they were carried out. Each project helped me face different challenges and learn 
            new ways to solve problems, which has been key to my professional growth.

                    My latest project is a product management web application where users can have multiple warehouses with their respective products. Based on the stored data, charts are generated automatically, and thanks to the integration of artificial intelligence, it is possible to create any kind of custom chart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, it features an AI-powered chat system that allows users to ask questions about how the site works or to inquire about product-related information, such as available stock, the most expensive product, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the main features is the scanner, which enables users to add or remove products from warehouses simply by scanning their barcodes.

                    This was my final project for DAW, to which I dedicated a lot of time and from which I learned a great deal. I used multiple libraries and APIs, and deepened my knowledge in technologies I was already familiar with, such as Angular and Symfony.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A standout feature of this project is the use of AI. Thanks to this, I developed an intelligent notification panel that alerts the user to any issues—from simple errors like a misspelled name in the database to more critical problems like low stock or inconsistent prices. Additionally, I implemented a chatbot with access to all user data, capable of answering questions related to the products, as well as an AI-powered chart generation system. The user simply specifies the desired chart, and the system automatically generates it based on the stored data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, I used the following technologies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symfony:</strong> I handled the backend, creating a RESTful API that connects with the frontend and manages all the logic and database interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Angular:</strong> The entire frontend was developed in Angular. I used libraries such as <code>chart.js</code>, <code>zxing/ngx-scanner</code> for barcode scanning, <code>OpenLayers</code> for interactive maps, among others. I also integrated the DeepSeek API for AI functionalities.</li>
                    <li><strong>HTML/CSS:</strong> Used to structure and style the interface components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong> Allowed me to quickly create a well-structured, responsive website.</li>
                    <li><strong>AWS:</strong> I utilized AWS services to deploy and host the application in production.</li>
                    <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> Used MySQL to create the database.</li>

                        This was a group project we carried out for an aesthetic clinic. The main focus was to create a well-crafted and visually appealing frontend, as this was the client’s top priority.

                    <p>
                        The website features a store section where users can purchase various available products. It also includes a booking section where you can select the service you want with the employee of your choice. Additionally, there are several informational pages explaining everything the clinic offers.

                    EcoBuddy was a team project focused on developing a social network aimed at promoting environmentally friendly actions. 
                    Users could share activities such as garbage collection, tree planting, and other sustainable initiatives.

                    Additionally, trophies were implemented as a gamification method to encourage ongoing user participation.
